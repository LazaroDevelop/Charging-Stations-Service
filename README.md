## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

To run the backend application I recommend using the Maven(CLI) to start the Spring Tomcat server:
* Execute the command ``` mvn dependency:resolve ``` to search application dependencies.
* Execute the command ``` mvn clean install ``` to generate the resources, run tests and build the application.
* Execute the command ``` mvn test ``` to run only the unitary tests.
* Execute the command ``` mvn spring-boot:run ``` to set up the application and then you can consume the REST API in the default port 8080.
* To see the documentation -> http://your_host:your_port/swagger-ui/index.html
